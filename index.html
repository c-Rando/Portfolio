      <p>
        Hello, I'm Chris, and I love coding, dogs, video games, and food! I wouldn't say that is all there is to me, but
        that sums up all of the important parts. I have worked many different jobs since I first started working. I
        believe that this
        factor has enabled me to become highly adaptive.
        Here is a brief description of my work experiences and something I feel that I gained from those experiences.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <ol class="about-me-content">
        <li>1. McDonalds:</li>
        <p>
          I started working at the age of 14. I worked in the kitchen here until I was 17, and felt like I was ready to
          graduate into more responsibility. This workplace taught me the value of quick, and responsive teamwork. The
          entire motto of McDonalds is "I'm lovin' it", and you won't be if you have to wait for your food.
        </p>
        <br>
        <li>2. Downs Ford Inc.:</li>
        <p>
          Yes, I used to be a salesman. No, they're not ALL bad people. This workplace leaned into many lessons about
          self-industry. Ford Motor Company <strong>REQUIRED</strong> us to continue our education, and our jobs
          depended on it. Here, I learned a wonderful analogy about "alligators in the swamp". You must tackle things
          that are <strong>immediate & urgent</strong> before moving to anything else. We must then tackle
          <strong>urgent</strong> tasks before moving to immediate tasks.
          Just because a task is nearby, and ready to be completed, doesn't mean that the task is urgent. If you get
          frazzled fighting alligators, you'll forget to drain the swamp.
        </p>
        <br>



        <li>3. Eastern Fire & Safety:</li>
        <p>
          I began here with very minimal experience, just an interest in our fire alarm system at another job. I
          applied, and was hired and trained to become a Fire Alarm technician.Finally, at this workplace, I learned a
          much greater technical understanding as well as developed my troubleshooting background. We basically worked
          on a "front-end" version of "back-end" software. Little to no training off the bat, I had to evolve and learn
          what "user-defined-functions", "syntaxes", "scope", etc. concepts were, then actually deliver on those
          concepts in the field. Oh, and it couldn't fail. <strong>EVER.</strong>
